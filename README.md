# language_translator

This Python application is a simple language translator designed using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and the googletrans library for translation. The window has a light blue background, with a title "Language Translator" displayed at the top using a bold Arial font. Users can input the text they want to translate into a text field labeled "Enter Text." Below this, a dropdown menu allows users to choose the target language for the translation, with the available languages populated dynamically using the googletrans.LANGUAGES list. Once the user selects a language and enters the text, they can click the "Translate" button to trigger the translation process. The application uses the Translator class from the googletrans library to perform the translation and outputs the translated text in a text box below the input field. The translated text is updated immediately upon clicking the "Translate" button. The layout is straightforward and user-friendly, with clearly labeled widgets for text input, output, and language selection, making the application easy to use for quick translations. The design is responsive, ensuring that it functions well on most screen sizes. This simple yet effective tool provides users with a convenient way to translate text between multiple languages.
